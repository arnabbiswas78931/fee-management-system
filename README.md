## Fee Management System
“Fee Management System (FMS)” is an online Fee Management System that can be used by any school that wants to update their manual or existing automated fee system.

It is designed to facilitate the users (at more ease) with customized fee records related to every student in every session and overall fee history on a single click.

It can be easily customized as per the requirements of the school. Students can submit fee as per the convenience of the accounts department on mercy basis. Static Fee Heads (fee heads that are enforced on everyone) and Flexible Fee Heads (applicable on individual students) can be added in every session (as per the requirement).

It can generate multiple reports for the management like monthly fee collection and class wise fee collection. It can help to identify the defaulters (students that have not cleared their dues) on a single click.

It reduces the amount of paper work involved in the manual fee management hence avoiding data redundancies and inconsistencies, thus making data storage more easy and efficient. 

The organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means one need not be distracted by information that is not relevant, while being able to reach the required information.
